# Godot ML Toolkit Plugin

The Godot ML Toolkit Plugin contains the Godot plugin for the Godot ML Toolkit library found in [here](https://github.com/campiao/godot_ml_agents_toolkit)

Godot ML Toolkit is an open-source project that allows video game developers to integrate intelligent agents into their games.
The main features are:
- Support for both single and multi agent environments using the Godot game engine
- Ability to control an agent through an algorithm or user I/O
- Speed up the simulation speed for faster training times

This project was built for an internship for my Bachelor's Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
